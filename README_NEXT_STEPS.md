# 🎉 Android Release Pipeline - SETUP COMPLETE!

## ✅ What We've Accomplished

Your Android app now has a **production-ready multi-environment release pipeline** with:

### 🏗️ Multi-Environment Build System
- **Development Environment** (`dev`): For testing with debug configs
- **Production Environment** (`prod`): For staging and live releases  
- **Build Types**: Debug, Staging (optimized), and Release (production)
- **Package Separation**: Different package IDs prevent conflicts

### 🤖 Automated CI/CD Pipeline
- **GitHub Actions workflow** that builds APKs for all environments
- **Automated signing** for staging and release builds
- **APK verification** ensures build integrity
- **Artifact uploading** for easy download and testing
- **Automatic releases** for tagged production builds

### 🔐 Security & Signing
- **Release keystore** properly configured and secured
- **Environment variable** support for CI/CD credentials
- **APK signing verification** in the build pipeline

### 📚 Complete Documentation
- Step-by-step guides for GitHub setup and Play Store deployment
- Troubleshooting guides and architecture overview
- Clear next steps for production deployment

## 🚀 READY FOR PRODUCTION - Next Steps

### 1. Configure GitHub Repository Secrets (5 minutes)

Go to your GitHub repository and add these secrets:

**Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**

```bash
# Get the base64 keystore value:
base64 -w 0 release/karage-app-keystore.jks

# Add these 4 secrets to GitHub:
SIGNING_KEY=<paste the base64 output here>
KEY_ALIAS=karage-app-key  
KEY_STORE_PASSWORD=android123
KEY_PASSWORD=android123
```

### 2. Test the GitHub Actions Workflow

Choose one of these methods:

**Option A - Create production branch:**
```bash
git checkout -b prod
git push origin prod
```

**Option B - Create version tag:**
```bash
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin v1.0.0  
```

**Option C - Manual trigger:**
Go to GitHub Actions tab → Release Build & Verification → Run workflow

### 3. Download and Test APKs

1. Go to GitHub Actions → Your workflow run → Artifacts
2. Download the APK artifacts
3. Install on Android devices:
   - Enable "Install from unknown sources" in device settings
   - Install and test the APKs

### 4. Deploy to Google Play Store

1. **Create Google Play Console account** ($25 one-time fee)
2. **Create new app** in Play Console
3. **Upload** the `prod-release` APK from GitHub artifacts
4. **Configure store listing** (description, screenshots, etc.)
5. **Submit for review**

See `PLAY_STORE_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions.

## 📱 Your Build Variants

| Variant | Package ID | Use Case | Optimized | Signed |
|---------|------------|----------|-----------|--------|
| `devDebug` | `com.karage.app.dev` | Development | ❌ | ❌ |
| `devStaging` | `com.karage.app.dev` | Dev testing | ✅ | ❌ |
| `prodStaging` | `com.karage.app` | Pre-production | ✅ | ✅ |
| `prodRelease` | `com.karage.app` | **Production** | ✅ | ✅ |

## 🔧 Local Testing Commands

```bash
# Test different environments locally:
./scripts/test-pipeline.sh

# Build specific variants:
./gradlew assembleDevDebug
./gradlew assembleProdStaging  
./gradlew assembleProdRelease

# Use the build script:
./scripts/build-release.sh prod release
```
